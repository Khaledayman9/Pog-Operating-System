# Pog-Operating-System
Pog OS is a simulation of a real operating systems implemented in Java for executing a bunch of processes using Round Robin scheduling algorithm, mutexes to ensure Mutual exclusion. Also swapping processes when executing from memory into disk and vice versa.


Here is an example when running the Simulation, having the 3 Programs (Program_1.txt,Program_2.txt,Program_3.txt) that will be turned into 3 Processes when they are created and inserted into the main memory and ready queue.
